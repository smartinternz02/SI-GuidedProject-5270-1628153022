ABSTRACT:

The aim of this project is to develops an online search Portal for the Placement Dept. of the college. The system is an online application that can be accessed throughout the organization and outside as well with proper login provided. This system can be used as an Online Job Portal for the Placement Dept of the college to manage the student information with regards to placement. Students logging should be able to upload their information in the form of a CV. Visitors/Company representatives logging in may also access/search any information put up by Students.
The project has been planned to be having the view of distributed architecture, with centralized storage of the database. The application for the storage of the data has been planned. Using the constructs of MS-SQL Server and all the user interfaces have been designed using the ASP.Net technologies. The database connectivity is planned using the “SQL Connection” methodology. The standards of security and data protective mechanism have been given a big choice for proper usage. The application takes care of different modules and their associated reports, which are produced as per the applicable strategies and standards that are put forwarded by the administrative staff.

Authentication:-

This module contains all the information about the authenticated user. User without his username and password can’t enter into the login if he is only the authenticated user then he can enter to his login.

BENEFITS:

The project is identified by the merits of the system offered to the user. The merits of this project are as follows: -

•	It’s a web-enabled project.

•	This project offers user to enter the data through simple and interactive forms. This is very helpful for the client to enter the desired information through so much simplicity.

•	The user is mainly more concerned about the validity of the data, whatever he is entering. There are checks on every stages of any new creation, data entry or updation so that the user cannot enter the invalid data, which can create problems at later date.

•	Sometimes the user finds in the later stages of using project that he needs to update some of the information that he entered earlier. There are options for him by which he can update the records. Moreover there is restriction for his that he cannot change the primary data field. This keeps the validity of the data to longer extent.

•	User is provided the option of monitoring the records he entered earlier. He can see the desired records with the variety of options provided by him.

•	From every part of the project the user is provided with the links through framing so that he can go from one option of the project to other as per the requirement. This is bound to be simple and very friendly as per the user is concerned. That is, we can sat that the project is user friendly which is one of the primary concerns of any good project.

•	Data storage and retrieval will become faster and easier to maintain because data is stored in a systematic manner and in a single database.

•	Decision making process would be greatly enhanced because of faster processing of information since data collection from information available on computer takes much less time then manual system.

•	Allocating of sample results becomes much faster because at a time the user can see the records of last years.

•	Easier and faster data transfer through latest technology associated with the computer and communication.

•	Through these features it will increase the efficiency, accuracy and transparency,
